# 🌦️ Simple Weather App

A lightweight weather application built with **JavaScript**, **OpenWeatherMap API**, and **Visual Crossing API**.  
It detects your current location, shows real-time weather conditions, and provides a 24-hour forecast along with yesterday’s and tomorrow’s weather.

🚀 How to Run This Project Locally

To run this application on your local machine, you need to set up the necessary API keys and use a local web server (since modern browsers restrict direct file system access for fetch and geolocation).

1. Prerequisites
API Keys: Obtain keys for the following services:

OpenWeatherMap: For current weather data.

Visual Crossing: For forecast data.

(Note: The BigDataCloud API for reverse geocoding is used without a key in the existing code.)

2. Setup and Configuration
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/HarinduVihan/Weather-app.git
cd Weather-app
Create the Configuration File:

In the root of the project directory, create a new file named config.json.

Add your API keys and the base URLs to this file in the following JSON format:

JSON

{
  "API_KEY": "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY",
  "API_URL": "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?units=metric&q=",
  "FORCAST_API_KEY": "YOUR_VISUAL_CROSSING_API_KEY",
  "FORCAST_API_URL": "https://weather.visualcrossing.com/VisualCrossingWebServices/rest/services/timeline/"
}

The application's JavaScript fetches these values from this file on startup.

Run a Local Web Server:

You cannot simply open index.html due to security restrictions (fetch and geolocation). You must use a local server.

Option A: VS Code Live Server (Recommended)

Install the "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey.

Right-click index.html in your file explorer and select "Open with Live Server".

Option B: Python's Simple Server

Open your terminal in the project root directory and run:

Bash

# For Python 3

python3 -m http.server 8000

# For Python 2

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 

Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8000
